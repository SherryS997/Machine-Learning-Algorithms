title: "Memory Systems and Processes"

## Working Memory
- **Definition**: A cognitive system with a limited capacity responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information for complex tasks such as reasoning and learning.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Limited capacity: Can hold only a few items at a time.
  - Active manipulation: Involves processing and transforming information.
  - Distinct from long-term memory, which stores information permanently.

## Long-Term Memory (LTM)
- **Definition**: A system for storing information over extended periods, from minutes to a lifetime.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Capacity: Virtually unlimited in size.
  - Duration: Information can remain for years or even decades.
  - Types of LTM:
    - **Explicit (Declarative) Memory**: Involves conscious recall, such as facts and events.
      - **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge and facts.
      - **Episodic Memory**: Personal experiences and specific events.
    - **Implicit (Non-declarative) Memory**: Involves unconscious retrieval, such as skills and habits.

## Word Length Effect
- **Definition**: The phenomenon where short words are recalled more accurately than long words in memory tasks.
- **Explanation**: This effect is attributed to the time it takes to rehearse longer words in the phonological loop, making them less likely to be remembered in short-term memory tasks.

## Phonological Loop
- **Definition**: A component of working memory responsible for storing verbal and auditory information.
- **Function**:
  - Maintains verbal information through rehearsal.
  - Critical for language processing and comprehension.

## Visuospatial Sketchpad
- **Definition**: A component of working memory that holds visual and spatial information.
- **Function**:
  - Allows for manipulation and analysis of visual data.
  - Essential for tasks requiring visual imagery, such as navigating spaces.

## Implicit Memory
- **Definition**: A type of memory that is used without conscious awareness, making its content difficult to verbalize.
- **Examples**: Skills such as riding a bike or typing, which are performed automatically.
- **Characteristics**: Less affected by age and neurological disorders compared to explicit memory.

## Procedural Memory
- **Definition**: A subtype of implicit memory that involves the acquisition of skills and procedures.
- **Examples**:
  - Cycling, swimming, and driving.
  - Developed through practice and repetition, these memories allow for automatic execution without conscious thought.

## Levels of Processing Theory
- **Proposers**: Craik & Lockhart.
- **Definition**: A theory that suggests the depth of processing affects memory retention.
- **Types of Processing**:
  - **Shallow Processing**: Focuses on surface features (e.g., phonetic or structural).
  - **Deep Processing**: Involves semantic analysis and connection to prior knowledge, leading to better retention.

## Elaborative Rehearsal
- **Definition**: A method of transferring information into long-term memory by relating it to existing knowledge or thinking about its meaning.
- **Advantages**:
  - Enhances understanding and retention.
  - Encourages deeper cognitive engagement with the material.

## Encoding Specificity
- **Definition**: The principle that memory retrieval is more effective when the conditions at the time of encoding match those at the time of retrieval.
- **Explanation**: Contextual cues present during encoding can trigger recall when those cues are encountered again, facilitating memory retrieval.

## Consolidation
- **Definition**: The process that transforms newly formed, fragile memories into a more stable and permanent state.
- **Mechanism**: Often occurs during sleep, allowing for the strengthening and integration of memories into long-term storage.
- **Importance**: Essential for protecting memories from disruption or decay.

## State Dependent Learning
- **Definition**: The phenomenon where retrieval of information is more successful when an individual is in the same emotional or physiological state during encoding and retrieval.
- **Example**: A person learning a task while happy may perform better when in a similar emotional state.
