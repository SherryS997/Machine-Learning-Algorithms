## Common Sense Psychology

### Stereotypes
- **Definition**: Oversimplified and generalized beliefs about groups of people.
- **Significance**: Often arise from common sense reasoning but can lead to misjudgments and reinforce biases.

### Confirmation Bias
- **Definition**: The tendency to favor information that confirms existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence.
- **Significance**: A common error in reasoning that can distort perception and hinder objective analysis.

### Availability Heuristics
- **Definition**: A mental shortcut where individuals judge the likelihood of events based on how easily examples come to mind.
- **Significance**: This heuristic can lead to skewed perceptions of reality, often overemphasizing recent or vivid experiences.

## Cognitive Functions of the Mind

### Perception
- **Definition**: The process of organizing and interpreting sensory information to understand the environment.
- **Function**: Essential for interaction with the world, enabling recognition of objects, sounds, and other stimuli.

### Attention
- **Definition**: The cognitive process of selectively focusing on specific information while ignoring other stimuli.
- **Function**: Crucial for learning and memory, attention determines what information enters our awareness.

### Memory
- **Definition**: The faculty of the mind that allows for the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information.
- **Function**: Enables the retention of experiences and knowledge over time, forming the basis of learning.

## Early Thinkers in Psychology

### Aristotle
- **View**: Proposed that mind and body are not entirely separate; he believed in the unity of soul and body.
- **Contribution**: Emphasized empirical observation and the study of nature, laying the groundwork for future scientific inquiry.

### Plato
- **View**: Advocated for dualism, asserting that the mind and body are different entities that interact.
- **Contribution**: His ideas influenced philosophical and psychological thought, particularly concerning the nature of knowledge and reality.

### Hippocrates
- **View**: Suggested that mental illnesses have physical causes, contrasting with supernatural explanations.
- **Contribution**: Pioneered the understanding of health and illness in a more scientific manner, emphasizing the biological basis of behavior.

## Modern Philosophical Perspectives

### Immanuel Kant
- **View**: Proposed that humans possess innate faculties—sense, understanding, and reasoning—that work together.
- **Contribution**: His work emphasized the importance of these faculties in linking the mind and body, influencing both philosophy and psychology.

## Major Psychological Theories and Figures

### J.B. Watson
- **Role**: Founder of behaviorism, focusing solely on observable behavior.
- **Contribution**: Advocated for the study of behavior without reference to mental processes, emphasizing the role of the environment.

### Ivan Pavlov
- **Role**: Discovered classical conditioning through his experiments with dogs.
- **Contribution**: Demonstrated how learning can occur through associations, influencing behavioral psychology.

### B.F. Skinner
- **Role**: Developed the concept of operant conditioning, building on Watson's work.
- **Contribution**: Highlighted the effects of reinforcement and punishment on behavior, shaping modern behavioral therapy.

### Gestalt Psychology
- **View**: Focuses on perception as an organized and structured whole, rather than isolated parts.
- **Contribution**: Emphasized the holistic nature of human perception and cognition, influencing fields like cognitive psychology.

## Language Acquisition

### Noam Chomsky
- **View**: Argued for the biological basis of language, proposing that humans are born with innate linguistic capabilities.
- **Contribution**: Introduced the concept of **Universal Grammar**, asserting that all human languages share a common structural basis.

---

## Key Psychological Laws

### Edward L. Thorndike
- **Law of Effect**: States that behaviors followed by satisfying outcomes are likely to be repeated, while those followed by unpleasant outcomes are less likely to recur.
- **Contribution**: Laid the foundation for future learning theories, particularly in operant conditioning.

## Psychological Approaches

### Behaviorism
- **View**: Rejects introspection and focuses on observable behavior as the primary subject of psychology.
- **Implication**: Emphasizes environmental influences on behavior, minimizing the role of free will and internal mental states.

### Structuralism
- **Definition**: Aimed to analyze the structure of the mind through introspection and subjective reports.
- **Limitations**: Often criticized for its reliance on subjective experience, making it less scientific.

### Functionalism
- **Definition**: Focuses on the purpose of mental processes and behavior in adapting to the environment.
- **Implication**: Emphasizes the role of mental processes in facilitating adaptation and survival.

---

## Evaluating Scientific Theories

### Karl Popper’s Philosophy
- **Falsifiability**: Asserts that for a theory to be scientific, it must be testable and refutable.
- **Testing**: Each genuine test is an attempt to falsify a theory rather than confirm it, ensuring scientific rigor.

---

## Identity Theories in Philosophy of Mind

### Token Identity Theory
- **Definition**: Proposes that specific mental events correspond to specific neurological events.
- **Implication**: Each instance of a mental state is tied to a particular brain state, offering a bridge between psychology and neuroscience.

### Type Identity Theory
- **Definition**: Asserts that types of mental states are identical to types of brain states.
- **Contrast with Token Identity**: Token identity focuses on individual instances, while type identity looks at broader categories of mental events.
