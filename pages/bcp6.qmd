## Cocktail Party Effect
- **Definition**: The ability to focus on a single conversation in a noisy environment, like at a party.
- **Researcher**: Colin Cherry, who studied how people can isolate one voice amidst many.
- **Significance**: Highlights the selective nature of auditory attention and how we filter out irrelevant sounds.

## Theories of Selective Attention
- **Bottleneck Theory**
  - **Explanation**: Suggests there is a point where information processing is limited, similar to a bottleneck in a physical passage. Only certain information can pass through for further processing.
  - **Importance**: Helps in understanding how we manage to focus in environments filled with distractions.
  
- **Filter Theory**
  - **Explanation**: Proposes that attention acts as a filter, allowing certain stimuli to be processed while ignoring others. This can occur at various stages of perception.
  - **Relation to Bottleneck**: Bottleneck theory can be seen as a specific application of filter theory, focusing on the limitations in processing capacity.

## Factors Influencing Attention
- **Anxiety**
  - **Impact**: High anxiety levels can hinder attention by causing distractions and impairing cognitive functions.
  
- **Arousal**
  - **Explanation**: Refers to the state of being physiologically alert. Both low and high arousal can negatively affect attention, while moderate arousal tends to enhance focus.
  
- **Skill & Task Difficulty**
  - **Role**: The complexity of a task and the individual's proficiency can significantly affect attention. Familiar tasks require less cognitive load, allowing for better focus.

## Michael Posner's Attentional System
- **Concept**: Posner suggests that attention is not confined to one specific area of the brain or the whole brain but involves multiple areas working together.
- **Relevance**: This view supports a more dynamic understanding of attention, highlighting the interplay between different brain regions.

## Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down Attention
- **Bottom-Up Attention**
  - **Definition**: Attention driven by external stimuli based on their physical characteristics (e.g., bright colors, loud sounds).
  - **Example**: A sudden noise that captures your focus without conscious effort.

- **Top-Down Attention**
  - **Definition**: Attention guided by prior knowledge, expectations, or goals. This type is more deliberate.
  - **Example**: Actively searching for a friend in a crowd based on your knowledge of their appearance.

## Covert Attention
- **Definition**: Focusing attention on a stimulus without any physical movement (like eye movements).
- **Application**: Useful in scenarios where one wants to gather information discreetly or without drawing attention to oneself.

## Modal Model of Memory
- **Proposers**: Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin.
- **Overview**: A framework explaining how information flows through memory systems: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory.
  - **Sensory Memory**: Briefly holds incoming sensory information.
  - **Short-Term Memory (STM)**: Temporary storage of information, limited in duration and capacity.
  - **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**: More permanent storage for information that can last from minutes to a lifetime.

## Short-Term Memory (STM)
- **Concept Originator**: Alan Baddeley.
- **Description**: Refers to the capacity to hold a small amount of information for a brief period. Baddeley expanded the idea into "working memory," which includes the manipulation of stored information.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Limited capacity (commonly cited as 7 Â± 2 items).
  - Information is easily lost unless actively maintained through rehearsal.

## Chunking
- **Definition**: A technique used in memory to group together elements that are strongly associated with one another, making them easier to remember.
- **Example**: Grouping the digits of a phone number into segments (e.g., 123-456-7890) instead of remembering each digit individually.
- **Purpose**: Enhances the capacity of memory by reducing the number of items to be remembered.

## Cues and Priming
- **Cue**
  - **Definition**: A stimulus that aids the retrieval of information from memory. Cues help trigger memories by providing context or association.
  
- **Prime**
  - **Definition**: A stimulus presented before a target stimulus to prepare the brain for recognition. Priming can influence how we perceive and respond to subsequent stimuli.
